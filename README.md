<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This repository documents my journey through the NeetCode 150, a curated list of LeetCode problems designed to prepare for technical interviews. By working through these problems, I aim to:

- Strengthen my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms
- Improve my problem-solving skills
- Prepare effectively for technical interviews
- Track my progress and growth over time

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Built With

[![Python][Python.org]][Python-url]

All solutions in this project are implemented using Python. Python was chosen for its readability, extensive standard library, and popularity in coding interviews.

## Structure

The repository is organized following the NeetCode 150 structure:

```
code
├── 01-Arrays & Hashing
├── 02-Two Pointers
├── 03-Stack
├── 04-Binary Search
├── 05-Sliding Window
├── 06-Linked List
├── 07-Trees
├── 08-Tries
├── 09-Backtracking
├── 10-Heap Priority Queue
├── 11-Intervals
├── 12-Greedy
├── 13-Graphs
├── 14-Advanced Graphs
├── 15-1-D DP
├── 16-2-D DP
├── 17-Bit Manipulation
└── 18-Math & Geometry
```

Each problem solved includes:

- A Python file with the solution
- A markdown file explaining my approach, time/space complexity, and key insights gained
